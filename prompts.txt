I'd like to start with a simple Hello World app in javascript. Sound ok?

This is great, thanks!

Yes, please add a smooth theme toggle (dark/light mode).

This does not appear to work. Any suggestions?

That works!  Now, help me set up AWS amplify. I have an existing AWS account and have connected Amplify to another project in my github account. Can I just change the settings in Amplify to point to this project instead?

i'm not sure which method to use. My existing Amplify app is using a production branch URL that I would like to use for this new app. Which do you suggest?

Ok, it works now in Amplify. Thank you. Next, I'd like to start placeholder screens for different steps the user will follow. Let's add a Responsive navigation menu with 5 initial main steps, and give step 3 several sub steps.

Can you log all my prompts (just the prompts, nor your responses) to a new file prompts.txt ?
