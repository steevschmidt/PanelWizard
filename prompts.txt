I'd like to start with a simple Hello World app in javascript. Sound ok?

Please add a smooth theme toggle (dark/light mode).

Now, help me set up AWS amplify. I have an existing AWS account and have connected Amplify to another project in my github account. Can I just change the settings in Amplify to point to this project instead?

I'm not sure which method to use. My existing Amplify app is using a production branch URL that I would like to use for this new app. Which do you suggest?

Ok, it works now in Amplify. Thank you. Next, I'd like to start placeholder screens for different steps the user will follow. Let's add a Responsive navigation menu with 5 initial main steps, and give step 3 several sub steps.

Thanks. Next, please remove the small circular bullet markers shown before the substeps, and decrease the space between the substeps.

Please review these existing files and let me know if you have any questions about the intent of this project, or comments on the current code.

Let's add some data validation to the Project Name.  What do you suggest?
