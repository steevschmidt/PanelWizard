## Panel Amps 240V Column

The `panel_amps_240v` column is **critical for accurate panel capacity calculations**. It converts all electrical loads to a standard 240V panel reference:

### **Calculation Rules**
- **240V appliances**: `panel_amps_240v` = `electrical_load_amps` (direct)
- **120V appliances**: `panel_amps_240v` = `electrical_load_amps` รท 2

### **Why This Matters**
- **Eliminates calculation errors** from voltage confusion
- **Standardizes panel capacity math** across all appliance types
- **Matches electrician thinking** (panel ratings are in 240V amps)
- **Enables simple addition** for total panel load calculations

### **Example Calculations**
| Appliance | Voltage | Load Amps | Panel Amps (240V) | Calculation |
|-----------|---------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| Heat Pump | 240V | 15A | 15A | 15A (direct) |
| Range | 240V | 40A | 40A | 40A (direct) |
| Space Heater | 120V | 12A | 6A | 12A รท 2 |
| Water Heater | 240V | 15A | 15A | 15A (direct) |

## Data Maintenance

### Adding New Products
1. Open the appropriate CSV file in Excel, Google Sheets, or a text editor
2. Add a new row with a unique `id` (e.g., `hp_011` for heat pumps)
3. Fill in all required fields, **ensuring `panel_amps_240v` is calculated correctly**
4. Save the file

### Updating Existing Products
1. Locate the product by `id` or `name`
2. Modify the relevant fields
3. **Verify `panel_amps_240v` calculation is still correct**
4. Save the file

### Data Validation Rules
- `electrical_load_amps` must be a positive number
- `voltage` must be either 120 or 240
- `panel_amps_240v` must equal `electrical_load_amps` for 240V appliances
- `panel_amps_240v` must equal `electrical_load_amps รท 2` for 120V appliances
- `cost_min` must be less than or equal to `cost_max`
- Boolean fields must be `true` or `false`

### Cost Ranges
Cost ranges represent typical installation costs including:
- Product cost
- Basic installation labor
- Basic electrical work
- Permits and inspections

Actual costs may vary based on:
- Geographic location
- Installation complexity
- Contractor rates
- Additional electrical work needed

## File Format Requirements

- Use UTF-8 encoding
- Separate fields with commas
- Enclose text fields in quotes if they contain commas
- Use consistent decimal places for numeric values
- Maintain consistent field ordering
- **Always verify `panel_amps_240v` calculations are correct**

## Integration with PanelWizard

These CSV files are loaded by the JavaScript application when Step 6 is activated. The data is parsed and used to:

1. Populate product selection interfaces
2. **Calculate electrical load requirements using `panel_amps_240v`**
3. Provide real-time capacity feedback
4. Generate product recommendations
5. Calculate total project costs

## Simplified Structure Benefits

The simplified CSV structure focuses on essential information:
- **Electrical requirements** for panel capacity calculations
- **Cost information** for budget planning
- **Installation details** for contractor guidance
- **Efficiency ratings** for energy savings calculations
- **Product specifications** for informed decision-making
- **Standardized panel capacity impact** for accurate calculations

This streamlined approach makes the files easier to maintain while preserving all critical functionality for the electrification planning tool.

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions to consider:
- Product images and links
- Regional availability
- Contractor recommendations
- Installation difficulty ratings
- Maintenance requirements
- Warranty information
- User reviews and ratings
